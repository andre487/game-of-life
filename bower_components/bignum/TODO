TODO:

* Bring the new dispatch system performance up to that of 1.2.x.

* Fix (expt 0 0) in maint branches as per the example in R6RS.

* Backport fix: (angle 1.0) must be inexact.

* Make various unary functions raise &assertion on wrong type argument.

* Decimal: Relax the constraint that 10 not divide n.

* Decimal: Find out why fn["+"]("#e1e-50") loops.

* Provide a choice among different implementations of exact integers,
  exact rationals, complex numbers, and inexact reals.

* Implement integers using another library, such as Leemon Baird's.

* Consider a BigDecimal class like Java's BigDecimal.

* Reimplement the performance benefit of using Number.prototype, but
  make it optional.

* Consider supporting a configuration where inexact reals are returned
  as primitive numbers but Number.prototype is not used.

* Avoid "x in y" out of concern for Object.prototype use.

* Consider type implementations that dynamically measure usage and
  change representations on-the-fly to improve performance (run-time
  optimization).
