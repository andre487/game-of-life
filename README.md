Game of life
============

The Game of life implementation

Task:
>Implement Conway's Game of Life.
> Requirements:
> * Support a large universe 2^64x2^64. The universe is mostly empty, except for the area with the object(s) (for example, four gliders moving away from the center in opposite directions).
> * There should be a simple UI with the possibility to configure the initial state of the universe (100 x 100), start the algorithm, and observe the changes. There should also be a function to store/load the state to/from a persistent storage.
